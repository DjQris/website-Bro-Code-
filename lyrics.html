    <h2>Lyrics</h2>
    <br>

    <pre>
        Oh-oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

        No-ooh

        When you feel it in your body you found somebody who
        Makes you change your ways like hanging with your crew
        Said you act like you're ready but you don't really know
        And everything in your past, you wanna let it go

        I've been there, done it, humped around, ha
        After all that this is what I found
        Nobody wants to be alone
        If you're touched by the words in this song
        Then maybe

        You got it, you got it bad
        When you're on the phone
        Hang up and you call right back (oh, you)
        You got it, you got it bad
        If you miss a day without your friend, your whole life's off track
        Know you got it bad when you're stuck in the house
        You don't wanna have fun
        It's all you think about
        You got it bad when you're out with someone
        But you keep on thinkin' 'bout somebody else
        You got it bad

        When you say that you love 'em
        And you really know
        Everything that used to matter, don't matter no more
        Like my money, all my cars
        (You can have it all back)
        Flowers, cards, and candy
        (I do it just 'cause I'm-)
        Said I'm fortunate to have you, girl
        I want you to know
        I really adore you
        All my people who know what's going on
        Look at your mate, help me sing my song

        Tell her, "I'm your man, you're my girl
        I'm gonna tell it to the whole wide world"
        Ladies say, "I'm you gIrl, you're my man
        Promise to love you the best I can"

        See I've been there, done it, humped around
        After all that this is what I found
        Every one of ya'll are just like me
        It's too bad that you can't see
        That you got it bad, hey

        You got it, you got it bad
        When you're on the phone
        Hang up and you call right back
        You got it, you got it bad
        If you miss a day without your friend, your whole life's off track
        Know you got it bad when you're stuck in the house
        You don't wanna have fun
        It's all you think about (look at yourself)
        You got it bad when you're out with someone
        But you keep on thinkin' 'bout somebody else
        You got it bad

        You got it, you got it bad
        When you're on the phone
        Hang up and you call right back
        You got it, you got it bad
        And if you miss a day without your friend, your whole life's off track
        Know you got it bad when you're stuck in the house
        You don't wanna have fun
        It's all you think about
        You got it bad when you're out with someone
        But you keep on thinkin' 'bout somebody else
